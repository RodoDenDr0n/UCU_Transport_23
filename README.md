# Lviv Transport Analysis

## About
- Obtaining information about public transport stops and routes from the results of the project "Optimization of transport connections Lviv UCU-2022.
- Collection of information about public transport traffic schedules in divisions of the Lviv City Council
- Development of algorithms for determining the fact of public transport visiting stops based on open data on public transport traffic, which are published in the GTFS format.
- Identification of metrics for the detection of mass non-compliance with public transport traffic schedules.
- Development of algorithms for calculating metrics for detecting mass non-compliance with public transport traffic schedules and their testing on data for one month.

## Content of the repository
- _tools_ - code for receiving the data of fact of visiting stops based on data gathered for certain day. Also storing in database.
- _data_ - all the data received by ourselves such as open sources and Lvivavtodor documentation.
- _analysis_ - code for analysis, building heatmaps, histograms, dashboard and running linear regression model for certain day.

## analysis
Here we will briefly analyse the code from the analysis directory and explain certain feartures that are meant to be understood. Directory `analysis` contains the following files:
- `bus_stops_histogram_builder.py`
- `heatmaps_builder.py`
- `interval_plot_builder.py`
- `intervals_for_stops_map_builder.py`
- `linear_regression.py`
